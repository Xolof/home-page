# Home Page

A simple portfolio page with a contact form.

Built with Flight PHP.

## Installation

The data is stored in the files `data/site.json` and `data/projects.json`.

You can create these files by copying the example files.

```
cp data/site.example.json data/site.json
cp data/projects.example.json data/projects.json
```

You can start the project with the PHP dev server (only for local environments, never in production).

`php -S localhost:8000 -t public`
